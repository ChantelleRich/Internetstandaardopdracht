                    Why anime?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We believe that anime is not just entertainment. 
                    It's a way to explore emotions, cultures, and relationships. As women in the anime fandom, we're here to offer our perspectives, highlight the powerful women in anime, and dive into the themes that resonate with us. We want to create a space where people can talk openly about anime, without judgment, and enjoy the magic of shared passion.

                    Who are we?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We are three friends who discovered a shared passion for anime and became even closer because of it. We all came from different backgrounds, but anime was the thread that connected us.
                    While anime has always been a big part of our lives, it was the connection it fostered between us that truly ignited our desire to create this podcast. With each episode, we aim to celebrate anime in all its forms, from the well-known to the weird, and share our thoughts, laughs, and insights with fellow fans.
                    
                    We realized that anime had created a unique space for us to share, connect, and grow as friends. Now, we want to bring that energy to you!

                <h3>Chantelle Richardson</h3>
                <p>
                    My name is Chantelle, i am 23 years old and my hobbies are watching anime and baking! 
I am originally from Curacao but i moved to The Netherlands to continue my studies and follow my dream of one day opening up a bakery!

My favorite anime and why?
I have so many favorite animes so having to choose just 1 is difficult but if i had to choose 1, i would choose Attack on Titan.
Why is it my favorite anime?
It's one of my favorites due to its intense and emotional soundtrack, which enhances both the action and drama of the story. The plot evolves from a simple fight for survival into a complex exploration of freedom, power, and the consequences of war. The characters, like Eren, Mikasa, and Armin, experience significant growth, making their struggles and relationships deeply engaging. Additionally, the anime offers strong female characters that  are very respectfully presented and portrayed
